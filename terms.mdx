# ONLINE TERMS OF SERVICE

These Online Terms of Service (“Agreement”) set out the terms on which Sent, Inc. (“Sent”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) will provide you (also referred to as “your” or “user”) access to and use of certain services available on or through our website(s) (e.g., [https://sent.dm/](https://sent.dm/)) and the domains, products, platforms, mobile application(s), or others services, content, or technology offered or provided by us (collectively, “Services”). You and Sent are referred to herein individually as a “Party” and jointly as the “Parties”. By indicating acceptance to this Agreement, via click-through or executing an ordering document which incorporates the terms and conditions herein, or otherwise accessing or using the Services, you are entering into a legally binding agreement with us. You hereby represent that you are of legal age, and are otherwise fully able and competent, to enter into a binding agreement. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the right to bind such organization to this Agreement, and the terms “you” and “user” will include both you, the individual user, and such organization. Certain Services may require registering with us or executing an order with us, and any such order is hereby incorporated into this Agreement.

If you are accessing or user our Services in connection with a relationship you may have with one of our other users (typically a business entity), you agree that the restrictions and other limitations in this Agreement shall apply to your access or use of the Services as between you and us (other agreements may cover your relationship with that other user).

**YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES IS SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND AN ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 11.5 OF THIS AGREEMENT, REQUIRING ALL DISPUTES TO BE RESOLVED BY WAY OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND OTHERWISE LIMITING YOUR REMEDY AGAINST US. PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW SECTION 11.5 FOR MORE INFORMATION.** We may revise and update this Agreement from time to time without prior notice to you and will post the updated Agreement to the Services. **ANY CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT BY US WILL APPLY IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.**

- (iii) You and Sent acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Services or your possession and use of the Services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Sent and the App Store, Sent, not the App Store, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms.

### 11.11 Entire Agreement
