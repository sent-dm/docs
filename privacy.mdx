Client Consumers who wish to exercise any privacy rights in connection with their Personal Information that has been submitted to us by a Client should inquire with the Client directly. Because we only process Client Consumers’ data upon instruction from that Client, Client Consumers who make a request directly to us should provide to us the name of the Client who submitted their Personal Information to us. If we are able to verify the Client, we will refer the request to that Client and support them as needed in responding to the request within a reasonable timeframe.
